    pyudev
    ======

    A binding to libudev.

    The :class:`Context` provides the connection to the udev device database
    and enumerates devices.  Individual devices are represented by the
    :class:`Device` class.

    Device monitoring is provided by :class:`Monitor` and
    :class:`MonitorObserver`.  With :mod:`pyudev.pyqt4`, :mod:`pyudev.pyside`,
    :mod:`pyudev.glib` and :mod:`pyudev.wx` device monitoring can be integrated
    into the event loop of various GUI toolkits.
