    """
    A single device with attached attributes and properties.

    This class subclasses the ``Mapping`` ABC, providing a read-only
    dictionary mapping property names to the corresponding values.
    Therefore all well-known dicitionary methods and operators
    (e.g. ``.keys()``, ``.items()``, ``in``) are available to access device
    properties.

    Aside of the properties, a device also has a set of udev-specific
    attributes like the path inside ``sysfs``.

    :class:`Device` objects compare equal and unequal to other devices and
    to strings (based on :attr:`device_path`).  However, there is no
    ordering on :class:`Device` objects, and the corresponding operators
    ``>``, ``<``, ``<=`` and ``>=`` raise :exc:`~exceptions.TypeError`.

    .. warning::

       Do **never** use object identity (``is`` operator) to compare
       :class:`Device` objects.  :mod:`pyudev` may create multiple
       :class:`Device` objects for the same device.  Instead simply compare
       devices by value using ``==`` or ``!=``.

    :class:`Device` objects are hashable and can therefore be used as keys
    in dictionaries and sets.

    They can also be given directly as ``udev_device *`` to functions wrapped
    through :mod:`ctypes`.
