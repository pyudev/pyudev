    An asynchronous observer for device events.

    This class subclasses :class:`~threading.Thread` class to asynchronously
    observe a :class:`Monitor` in a background thread:

    >>> from pyudev import Context, Monitor, MonitorObserver
    >>> context = Context()
    >>> monitor = Monitor.from_netlink(context)
    >>> monitor.filter_by(subsystem='input')
    >>> def print_device_event(device):

    >>> observer = MonitorObserver(monitor, callback=print_device_event, name='monitor-observer')
    >>> observer.daemon
    True
    >>> observer.start()

    In the above example, input device events will be printed in background,
    until :meth:`stop()` is called on ``observer``.

       Instances of this class are always created as daemon thread.  If you do
       not want to use daemon threads for monitoring, you need explicitly set
       :attr:`~threading.Thread.daemon` to ``False`` before invoking
       :meth:`~threading.Thread.start()`.

       :attr:`Device.action`
          The action that created this event.
