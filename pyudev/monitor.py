    ...     print('{0}: {1}'.format(action, device))
    ...

    A :class:`Monitor` objects connects to the udev daemon and listens for
    changes to the device list.  A monitor is created by connecting to the
    kernel daemon through netlink (see :meth:`from_netlink`).
    Alternatively, connections to arbitrary daemons can be made using
    :meth:`from_socket`, which is however only seldom of use.

    Once the monitor is created, you can add a filter using
    :meth:`filter_by` to drop incoming events in subsystems, which are not
    of interest to the application.

    If the monitor is eventually set up, you can either iterate over the
    :class:`Monitor` object.  In this case, the monitor implicitly starts
    listening, and polls for incoming events.  Such events are then yielded
    to the caller.  Iteration is a blocking operation and does not integrate
    into external event loops.  If such integration is required, you can
    explicitly enable the monitor (see :meth:`enable_receiving`), and then
    retrieve a file descriptor using :meth:`fileno`.  This file descriptor
    can then be passed to classes like
    :class:`~PyQt4.QtCore.QSocketNotifier` from Qt4.

    Instances of this class can directly be given as ``udev_monitor *`` to
    functions wrapped through :mod:`ctypes`.
